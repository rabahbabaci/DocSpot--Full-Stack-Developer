# Acme Fruit Purchase Dashboard

Created by **Rabah Babaci** for the DocSpot Full-Stack Developer application (November 2025).

This simple dashboard visualizes Acme’s fruit purchase data using **Google Charts**.  
It aggregates transactions into clear, actionable insights to help identify buying patterns and improve future decisions.

### 📊 Features
- **Bar Chart:** Total units purchased by fruit type.  
- **Line Chart:** Monthly purchase trends across fruits.  
- **Responsive Design:** Clean, minimal layout for readability.  

### 🧠 Questions Addressed
1. Which fruits are purchased most often over time?  
2. How do purchase volumes change month to month?

### 💡 Potential Improvement
If additional data were available, an *“Employee Feedback (1–5)”* column could link satisfaction with purchasing habits to guide healthier, cost-effective decisions.
